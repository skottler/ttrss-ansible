Simple ansible playbook to setup tiny-tiny rss ontop of fedora 18(ish).

 - setup an instance somewhere (amazon, for example)
 - make sure you have allowed for ports 22 and 80 in your security group
 - run this playbook like:
   ansible-playbook -i 'my_ip_here,' -s -u whatevrusername playbook.yml

at the end you should have a working ttrss at: yourip/ttrss

login as 'admin' password is 'password'
